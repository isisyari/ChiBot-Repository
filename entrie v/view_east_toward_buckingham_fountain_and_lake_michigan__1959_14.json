    "Descriptive Text": "In 1959, Queen Elizabeth II visited Chicago to commemorate the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, which provided access for transoceanic ships from the St. Lawrence River in Canada via the Great Lakes to Chicago. The city's business and political leaders had planned the visit to coincide with the Chicago International Trade Fair being held at Navy Pier. Seen on the far left of the photograph is the royal yacht Britannia, which the Queen and Prince Philip had sailed down the seaway to Chicago. Buckingham Fountain (1927) can also be seen."
