    "Descriptive Text": "Kane County, 47 miles W of the Loop. Nineteenth-century settlers traveled the Oregon and St. Charles Road to Virgil. Residents of Virgil in the early twentieth century witnessed the town at its peak with a general store, bank, and creamery. Later, many of these business sites near Route 64 were dormant. As part of the townspeople's resistance to change, they succeeded in blocking a planned landfill by incorporating in 1990, with a population of 319.",
