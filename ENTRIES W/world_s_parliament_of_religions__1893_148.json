    "Title": "World's Parliament of Religions, 1893",
    "Descriptive Text": "While the religious unity that some participants hoped to find in the 1893 World's Parliament of Religions may have been elusive, the gathering succeeded in establishing a dialogue between representatives of religions and denominations from around the world. In the century after the Parliament, the religious traditions to be found in the Chicago metropolitan area became even more diverse than those represented by delegates to the 1893 Parliament."
