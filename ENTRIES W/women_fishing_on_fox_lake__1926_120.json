    "Title": "Women Fishing on Fox Lake, 1926",
    "Descriptive Text": "Fishing was not just the province of boys. This photograph shows two young women in a rowboat on Fox Lake in 1926. One woman holds up the large fish she caught. While many children made fishing poles of sticks and strings, these young women have more elaborate equipment, including the boat, finer fishing poles, and nets."
