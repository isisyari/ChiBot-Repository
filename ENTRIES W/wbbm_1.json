    "Descriptive Text": "This radio (and later television) station has long been Chicago's link to CBS. WBBM-AM went on the air in November 1923; WBBM-FM followed in December 1941. WBBM-FM long duplicated the AM broadcast, but as FM ascended in popularity in the late twentieth century it tried a number of different music formats. WBBM-AM pioneered all-news broadcasting.WBBM-TV began as WXBK in 1940, affiliated with Balaban and Katz, but in 1953 was sold to CBS in a complex swap whereby CBS took over WBBM-TV, and ABC took over WLS-TV. WBBM's McClurg Court studios have long been a Chicago fixture.",
