    "Title": "Wreckage of the Rush Street Bridge, 1863",
    "Descriptive Text": "On November 3, 1863, the Rush Street Bridge was destroyed. The bridge was crowded with a herd of cattle when the whistle of a passing ship spooked the cattle, who stampeded off the bridge and into the river. The accident was described as \"the most serious one of its kind\" in the history of Chicago. The bridge was repaired and was still in use on the night of October 8, 1871, when it was destroyed by the Chicago Fire."
