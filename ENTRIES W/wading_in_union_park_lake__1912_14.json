    "Title": "Wading in Union Park Lake, 1912",
    "Descriptive Text": "Union Park on Chicago's Near West Side was one of the city's first public parks. When this lake was created in the mid-nineteenth century, it was envisioned as a scenic backdrop for people walking or riding through the park. By 1912, children waded in the small lake on hot summer days. Note that while some of the children had bathing suits, others were wading in what appears to be their street clothes.",
