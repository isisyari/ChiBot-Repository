    "Title": "Wilson Bathing Beach, 1919",
    "Descriptive Text": "In 1916, within a year of the opening of Clarendon Municipal Beach, a violent clash erupted between city beachgoers and members of the neighboring private Wilson Avenue Beach. In an attempt to keep municipal bathers out of the waters and off of the beaches owned by the Wilson Beach Company, lifeguards and members beat a boy whom they claimed had not paid his admittance fee. The Chicago Tribune explained that \"bathers from other beaches can be distinguished from those who pay admittance fees by the manner of bathing suits they wear.\""
