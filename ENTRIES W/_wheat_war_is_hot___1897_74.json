    "Title": "\"Wheat War Is Hot,\" 1897",
    "Descriptive Text": "Philip Armour used his tremendous grain storage capacity on Goose Island and across the country to break another attempted corner on the wheat market in 1897-98. His adversary in 1897 was Joseph Leiter, the son of Levi Z. Leiter, a successful Chicago merchant. Armour even hired tugboats to keep the water open in the Duluth harbor until grain vessels could bring the wheat to Chicago."
