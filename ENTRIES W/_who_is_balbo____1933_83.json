    "Title": "\"Who is Balbo?,\" 1933",
    "Descriptive Text": "Italo Balbo, the namesake of Balbo Avenue in Chicago's south Loop, was a fascist party leader and close associate of dictator Benito Mussolini. As Mussolini's Ministry of Air, Balbo attracted worldwide attention by leading the Italian Formation Flight from Rome to Chicago during the World's Fair of 1933. Upon his arrival in Chicago, Balbo and his Italian flying unit were received as dignitaries and a street was named in his honor to commemorate the visit. As this broadside printed by the Italian Socialist Federation and the Italian League for the Rights of Man indicates, not everyone in the city welcomed the pilot so warmly."
