    "Title": "Warrant Issued by American Fur Company, 1824",
    "Descriptive Text": "This warrant for the arrest of Guilleaume Varin, issued by the circuit court in Michilimackinac County, Michigan Territory in 1824, suggests the power of the American Fur Company across its broad trading area. Michilimackinac was located at the center of the company's Great Lakes operations, where Lake Huron meets Lake Michigan with easy water access to Lake Superior and the surrounding territory. The inclusion of the three company official's names (John Jacob Astor, Ramsay Crooks, and Robert Stuart) ensured that traders and company agents as far away as Chicago would be on the look out for Varin.",
