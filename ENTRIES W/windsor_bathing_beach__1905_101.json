    "Title": "Windsor Bathing Beach, 1905",
    "Descriptive Text": "Windsor Bathing Beach at 75th and the lake, established in the early 1890s, boasted Windsor Beach Hall in G. (George) Nichol's Natatorium and a grand pier. It earned a reputation as one of the cleanest private beaches in the city and advertised as such to attract more paying members. The beach was reclaimed by the city in the early twentieth century to establish a municipal beach that extended from 75th to 77th Streets."
