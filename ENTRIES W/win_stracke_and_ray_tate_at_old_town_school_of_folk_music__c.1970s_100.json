    "Title": "Win Stracke and Ray Tate at Old Town School of Folk Music, c.1970s",
    "Descriptive Text": "Win Stracke (left) began his folk singing career in Chicago in 1931. Working with his friend and radio personality Studs Terkel, Stracke used his music to promote and assist the labor movement of the mid-twentieth century. In 1957, intending to improve his own skills as a guitar player, Stracke joined with Dawn Greening to found the Old Town School of Folk Music and then became its first director. Stracke is shown here with Ray Tate, the School's second director, in front of Old Town's second home at 909 W. Armitage Avenue, acquired in 1968 when its original building at 333 W. North Avenue was demolished. Tate served as director from 1971 to 1981. Stracke continued to perform and support the school until his death in 1991."
