    "Title": "\"Wrigley Airs Goose Island Plan,\" 2002",
    "Descriptive Text": "The William Wrigley Jr. Company closed a deal in March 2003 to build a 300,000 square-foot research center on Goose Island. This research facility took the lead on redevelopment on the island after Divine Inc., a Chicago high-tech enterprise that did not meet expectations, was unable to build its planned showcase headquarters on the site. Traditional industry generally balked at the high real estate costs on Goose Island. Instead, Kendall College opened a new Riverworks Campus on the south end of Goose Island in 2004, joining the Wrigley research center and other innovative neighbors.",
