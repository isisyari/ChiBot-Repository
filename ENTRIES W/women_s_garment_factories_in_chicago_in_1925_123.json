    "Title": "Women's Garment Factories in Chicago in 1925",
    "Descriptive Text": "Chicago once had a thriving women's garment manufacturing industry. In 1925, during its heyday, it was located principally in three concentrations. The main garment district was on South Market Street (the site of later South Wacker Drive) between Monroe and Van Buren Streets. Secondary concentrations were found on the Near West Side, both southwest of downtown and around Milwaukee Avenue between Chicago and North Avenues. The industry declined with foreign competition and outsourcing of production."
