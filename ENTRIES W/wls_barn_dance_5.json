    "Title": "WLS Barn Dance",
    "Descriptive Text": "Although nearly forgotten today, this variety program begun in 1924 ranked as America's most popular country music radio show through the 1930s and 1940s. By 1931 increased power meant a broadcast could be heard throughout the United States and Canada. In 1932 it moved to the Eighth Street Theater; a year later it was renamed The National Barn Dance, when the NBC network nationally broadcast a segment. Stars included Gene Autry, George Gobel, Red Foley, Homer and Jethro, Lulu Belle, and Scotty. Lack of success on TV signaled the end in 1957, but limited editions survived until 1971 (finally on WGN radio).",
