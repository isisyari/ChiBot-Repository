    "Title": "Woodstock Daily Sentinel, 1953",
    "Descriptive Text": "In the twentieth century, township governments have often had diminished significance near Chicago, although township-based high school districts remain a part of daily consciousness for many. In outlying areas, however, township governments have maintained a stronger hold. State Senator Robert McClory, later a U. S. Representative, in 1953 spoke to constituents in McHenry County about the persisting importance of township government."
