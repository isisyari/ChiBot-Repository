  "title": "American Civil Liberties Union", 

  "descriptive_text": "Chicagoans have been active in the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), on both the local and national levels, since the organization's founding in 1920. Based in New York City, the ACLU evolved from earlier groups that responded to attacks on American pacifists during World War I and sought to defend the civil rights of conscientious objectors. The American Union Against Militarism, established in 1916, gave birth to the National Civil Liberties Bureau, which then became the ACLU. Although initially Chicago did not have a local branch of the ACLU, its residents were among the national organization's most prominent members. Jane Addams stood among the founding members and Clarence Darrow represented the ACLU in its first major case, the Scopes Monkey Trial. In 1929 Chicago members of the ACLU grew alarmed at what they saw as increasing police repression in the city. The group formally incorporated in 1931 as the Chicago Civil Liberties Committee and established a permanent office in downtown Chicago. Although affiliated with the national organization of the ACLU, the Chicago Civil Liberties Committee was an autonomous body. During the 1930s, the group's initial membership of a few dozen grew to about a thousand members. Many of the cases handled by the committee during its first few years involved defending the rights of African Americans, the unemployed, and Communist groups. In addition, the Chicago Civil Liberties Committee investigated charges of police brutality and “third degree” cases of coerced confessions. The CCLC gained a great deal of attention for attacking the local censorship of films and newsreels. During World War II, internal partisan divisions wracked the membership of the Chicago Civil Liberties Committee. Debate surged over the relevance of civil liberties in the Soviet Union, the ACLU's defense of the legal rights of American Fascists, and endorsement of President Roosevelt and his economic policies. In 1945 the national organization of the ACLU accused the CCLC of partisanship and Communist leanings and threatened the committee with expulsion. In response, the CCLC disaffiliated itself from the national organization, but a group of non-Communist members re-formed and reincorporated as the Chicago Division of the American Civil Liberties Union. In 1954, the group changed its name to the Illinois Division of the American Civil Liberties Union in recognition of its expanded activities across the state. Now known as the ACLU of Illinois, the organization has engaged in hundreds of important civil rights cases in recent decades. In the mid-1970s, the ACLU of Illinois was widely criticized when it defended the rights of neo-Nazis who sought to hold a public march in Skokie, a community with a large Jewish population north of the city, where about 10 percent of the population were German concentration camp survivors. Many local members of the ACLU quit the organization in protest. In the late 1990s, the ACLU of Illinois fought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to defeat the city of Chicago's attempts to institute an antiloitering ordinance. The city wanted the ordinance to crack down on gang activity, but the ACLU saw it as an infringement on the rights of law-abiding citizens.",

  "Title": "Air Quality",
  "Descriptive Text": "Like most large cities, Chicago has a history of poor air quality. As it industrialized, Chicago relied on the dirty soft coal of southern Illinois for power and heat. Burned in boiler rooms, locomotives, steel mills, and domestic furnaces, the ubiquitous coal created an equally ubiquitous smoke. Soot soiled everything in the city, ruining furniture, merchandise, and even building facades. Chicago legislated against dense smoke in 1881, but residents and visitors continued to complain about choking clouds and filthy soot. In addition to smoke, the numerous industries surrounding the slaughterhouses produced foul odors and dangerous chemical emissions, further diminishing air quality. Undoubtedly the poor air increased the severity of several pulmonary diseases, including asthma and pneumonia. Perhaps second only to Pittsburgh in smoke pollution at the opening of the twentieth century, Chicago gained a national reputation for its terrible air, but it also became a leader in regulation. In the early 1900s, a movement to force railroad electrification focused on the Illinois Central's waterfront line and kept the smoke issue in the news. Still, air quality did not significantly improve until coal use began to decline after World War II. In 1959 the city created the Department of Air Pollution Control. The new department investigated all types of emissions and suggested regulations for several previously ignored sources of pollution, including burning refuse and leaves. Public concern for air quality heightened after a 1962 disaster killed hundreds of London residents, and by 1964 Chicago received more than six thousand citizen air pollution complaints per year. As with the early movement to control smoke, the new activism focused on the potential negative health effects of impure air. Not surprisingly, the Loop, the Calumet Region, and northern Lake County, Indiana, were the most polluted districts in the metropolitan area. In 1967 the U.S. Public Health Service determined that only New York City's air was more polluted than Chicago's. Impelled by citizen activism and new federal regulations in the 1970s, the city attempted to control the largest polluters, including the massive South Works steel plant. Even as these efforts began to reap benefits, however, the continuing suburbanization and auto dependence of the metropolitan area meant that auto emissions would plague the city for decades to come. By the 1990s, a decline in heavy industry and effective regulation of auto emissions combined to significantly improve Chicago's air. Chicago no longer ranked among the nation's most heavily polluted cities.",

  "Descriptive Text": "Chicago is known for its public sculpture, though it also has a rich tradition in murals and other forms of decoration of public spaces. The first forms were the panoramas and cycloramas that were painted and exhibited before being sent on the road, starting in the late 1850s, but the earliest surviving works are two sculptures by Chicagoan Leonard W.
