    "Descriptive Text": "Lake County, 32 miles NW of the Loop. Green Oaks originally incorporated as Oak Grove in 1960. Initial zoning prohibited all but single-family dwellings on lots between one and five acres. In 1989 the village annexed Lamb's Farm, a nonprofit commercial attraction that serves adults with mental disabilities. While land on the west side of the toll road remained residential, Green Oaks began annexing land east of the tollway in unincorporated Rondout for industry. Businesses included a concrete plant and a recycling plant.",
