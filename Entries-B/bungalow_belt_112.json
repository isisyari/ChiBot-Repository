    "Title": "Bungalow Belt",
    "Descriptive Text": "Powerfully combining architecture, housing distribution, race, and politics, “bungalow belt” is a quintessential Chicago term, referring generally to the bungalow-style single-family houses built in the 1910s and 1920s in a collar just inside the limits of the city of Chicago. A variety of racial and ethnic groups have owned these homes, from African American families on the far South Side to Orthodox Jewish families on the far North Side. Despite this diversity, this term generally connotes the primarily white residents of the far Northwest and Southwest Sides who became the main support of Richard J. Daley and his Democratic machine after 1968.",
