    "Descriptive Text": "Trinity International University, in Deerfield, is a private, four-year liberal arts college and seminary founded in 1897 in the evangelical Christian tradition.Organized by the Evangelical Free Church, Trinity operated on the model typified by Moody Bible Institute in Chicago. Each offered short-term missionary training courses, though Trinity merged with Trinity Seminary and Bible Institute of Minneapolis in 1946, and began to confer the baccalaureate degree in 1954.The college and seminary separated in 1974, when the college also severed its ties to the Evangelical Free Church. These associations were restored 10 years later, and in 1993 Trinity established a branch campus in Florida at the former Miami Christian College.Trinity has been noted for its contributions to conservative Protestant theology, and for the prolific matriculation of its graduates into professional Christian ministry.",
