    "Descriptive Text": "Known by its residents as the “ Mexico of the Midwest,” Little Village, officially a part of the South Lawndale Community Area, has over the past 35 years joined Pilsen as a point of entry for Latino immigrants to Chicago. A gateway on 26th Street proclaims “Bienvenidos a Little Village.” Neighborhood organizations like the United Neighborhood Organization have sought to curb gang violence and foster a sense of community solidarity. Little Village hosts the largest annual Latino parade in Chicago, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators each September.",
