    "Title": "Beecher, IL",
    "Descriptive Text": "Will County, 37 miles S of the Loop. Timothy L. Miller successfully raised then-rare longhorn Hereford cattle here by the 1870s. An influx of German settlers was followed by incorporation in 1883 and the arrival of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad in 1905. Beecher changed very slowly in subsequent decades. The Shady Lawn Golf Course inhabits the former Miller estate, and a caf√© occupies the 1850 Old Stage Tavern building. Over 53 percent of its residents claim German heritage, and five of its seven churches represent the Lutheran denomination.",
