    "Title": "Street Raising on Lake Street between Clark and LaSalle Streets, 1850s",
    "Descriptive Text": "Chicago's swampy setting led to its literally raising itself out of the mud. Several buildings were not only lifted but also moved to different locations. In this view of Lake Street in 1857, the work goes on in the background, while the cosmopolitan Chicagoans on horseback, in carriages, or on foot seem to pay little mind.",
