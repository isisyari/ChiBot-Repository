    "Title": "Sturges, Buckingham & Co.",
    "Descriptive Text": "This grain elevator company was founded in 1855 by Solomon Sturges and his brothers-in-law C. P. Buckingham and Alvah Buckingham. By 1857, they owned 120-foot elevators at the Illinois Central Railroad depot. During the Civil War, their two elevators had a capacity of 700,000 bushels each, which made Sturges, Buckingham & Co. the city's leading grain warehousing firm. In 1865, John Buckingham and Ebenezer Buckingham took over management of the elevators. By 1873, the Buckinghams' elevators had a capacity of nearly 2.9 million bushels of grain. The partnership ended with death of John Buckingham in 1881."
