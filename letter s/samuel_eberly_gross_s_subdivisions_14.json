    "Descriptive Text": "As a real-estate developer in Chicago in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Gross built more than 21 subdivisions and 10,000 homes. He developed working-class areas such as New City (near the stockyards) and middle-class subdivisions such as Alta Vista Terrace and Grossdale (now Brookfield ).His success was due to a number of factors: his use of standardized house plans and mass-produced building materials; his location of subdivisions near existing or planned transportation lines; and his mastery of promotion and marketingâ€”especially campaigns geared toward the working man and the immigrant.",
