    "Title": "Swimming around a Dam on the Desplaines River, 1926",
    "Descriptive Text": "While natural swimming holes existed, areas around dams, such as this one along the Des Plaines River in 1926, created areas of deeper water. Here children and adults wade and swim in the artificial lake created by the dam seen in the forefront. Access to areas like this one was facilitated by wider automobile ownership by the 1920s (note the line of cars along the west bank)."
