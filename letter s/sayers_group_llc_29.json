    "Title": "Sayers Group LLC",
    "Descriptive Text": "In 1984, former Chicago Bears Hall of Fame running back Gale Sayers and his wife, Ar dythe Sayers, founded the Sayers Group LLC in the Chicago suburb of Mount Prospect. In the beginning, the small company sold computerrelated supplies such as printer cartridges and fax machines. By the mid-1990s, the Sayers Group had expanded to establish itself as a national leader in selling used and refurbished computers to households and businesses. The Sayers Group took advantage of the technology sector bust of the early 2000s by acquiring devalued computer and Internet-related companies. By 2003, the company was still involved in its earlier operations but had diversified into the fields of Internet consultancy and asset management, with offices in several states. At that time, the Sayers Group employed about 100 people nationwide; 60 of those worked at its Mount Prospect headquarters. With annual revenues around $300 million, the Sayers Group was one of the Chicago's largest minority-owned firms."
