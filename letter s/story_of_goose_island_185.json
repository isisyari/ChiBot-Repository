    "Title": "Story of Goose Island",
    "Descriptive Text": "All of the Goose Island residents portrayed in this 1885 line drawing represented racist stereotypes: the ruddy cheeked, barefoot young lady; the barefoot and foot stomping drinker; and the gang of workers (seemingly returned from their jobs digging ditches). The ramshackle shanties, unpaved streets, and geese flying overhead complete the scene."
