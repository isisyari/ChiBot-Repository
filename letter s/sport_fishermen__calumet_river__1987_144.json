    "Title": "Sport Fishermen, Calumet River, 1987",
    "Descriptive Text": "While commercial fishing declined in the second half of the twentieth century, sport fishing on Chicago's rivers and lakes remained popular. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources stock trout, salmon and other fish (as do their counterparts in neighboring states). Fishermen also come to Lake Michigan for spring smelt-runs. Seen in this 1987 photograph are sport fishermen at the mouth of the Calumet River (Ewing and 92nd).",
