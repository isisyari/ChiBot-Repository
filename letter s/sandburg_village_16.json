    "Title": "Sandburg Village",
    "Descriptive Text": "Neighborhood in the Near North Side Community Area. Sandburg Village stands on the former divide between the slums of the Near North Side and the Gold Coast. In 1961, the city accepted a $6,411,000 bid from a group of investors headed by Arthur Rubloff to erect high-rise rental apartment buildings on cleared urban renewal land located between Division Street and North Avenue along Clark and LaSalle. They named the complex for poet Carl Sandburg and the buildings for other literary luminaries. Although less expensive than those in neighboring Gold Coast, the apartments were far beyond the range of former residents. The new inhabitants were mostly middle-income, young professionals. Subsequent townhouses appealed to white families contemplating moving to the suburbs. In 1979, Sandburg Village converted to condominium ownership.",
