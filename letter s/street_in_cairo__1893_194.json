    "Title": "Street in Cairo, 1893",
    "Descriptive Text": "The Street in Cairo, modeled on the Rue de Caire at the 1889 Paris Exposition, was the most popular ethnographic attraction on the Midway. The Islamic architecture and Egyptian visitors formed a colorful stage set, where tourists could buy exotic souvenirs and ride on donkeys and camels. The scene was further enlivened by daily performances of local spectacles such as \"The Arrival from Mecca\" and \"The Wedding Procession.\" This pen-and-ink drawing was made by John T. McCutcheon, a staff artist for the Chicago Record."
