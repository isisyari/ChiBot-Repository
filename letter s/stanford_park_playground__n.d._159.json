    "Title": "Stanford Park Playground, n.d.",
    "Descriptive Text": "Stanford Park (which no longer exists) was one of the first small neighborhood parks with recreational facilities. It was constructed in 1907 by the West Park Commission. As this photograph indicates, these playgrounds proved very popular, which soon led to the authorization of additional similar parks."
