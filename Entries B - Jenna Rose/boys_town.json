  "Title": "Boys Town",
  "Descriptive Text": "The boundaries of the neighborhood known as Boys Town stretch from about 3100 to 3800 North Halsted. The unofficial designation of Boys Town as an area within Lake View dates back to 1970, when residents marched here in the first annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe city of Chicago proposed a $3.2 million facelift for the area in 1997. These improvements included a plan to commemorate Boys Town's gay and lesbian residents that would mirror similar efforts on behalf of residents in Chicago's ethnic-identified neighborhoods. The city erected eleven pairs of 23-foot-high art-deco-style pillars with rainbow rings in 1998.",
