    "Descriptive Text": "Fibber McGee and Molly (1935–1956), created by Peoria natives Jim and Marian Jordan and writer Don Quinn, rated among the top five radio programs throughout the 1940s. Before moving it to Hollywood in 1939, NBC broadcast the weekly comedy from WMAQ -Chicago.The good-natured, disorganized McGee, named for his tall tales, and his sensible, forbearing wife, Molly, interacted with colorful neighbors in domestic situations. Fibber's overflowing closet exemplified the show's humorous take on daily life. Regularly dramatizing current events such as wartime rationing, the show served as a semiofficial propaganda vehicle during World War II. Its cancellation reflected television's growing prominence.",
