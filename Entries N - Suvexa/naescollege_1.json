    "Descriptive Text": "Native American Educational Services (NAES) College was established in Chicago in 1974 to promote the use of tribal knowledge, traditions, and values in higher education of Native American students. The only independent, Native-owned and -controlled college in the country, NAES College promotes an individualized and research-oriented educational program. The college directs students toward a single degree—a bachelor of arts in public policy—that encourages community leadership and development. In addition to its Chicago campus in the West Ridge neighborhood, NAES College established campuses in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, on the Menominee Reservation in Wisconsin, and on the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. NAES College allows students to remain at home to fulfill family and community responsibilities while completing their baccalaureate degree. Despite a 10 percent Native student graduation rate in most mainstream colleges, NAES College records a 70 percent retention rate through graduation.",
