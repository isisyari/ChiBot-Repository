    "Title": "Council on Fine Arts",
    "Descriptive Text": "Authorized by a 1975 ordinance to encourage public support for and understanding of the arts, the 15-member, mayor-appointed Chicago Council on Fine Arts (CCFA) began work in December 1976, led by Executive Director (and noted cultural activist) Heather Morgan. Under Morgan and her successors, the CCFA initiated a host of innovative projects: a “culture bus” to major arts centers; free performances in the Daley Civic Center and other venues; guidebooks and calendars for potential arts patrons; artists-in-residence in previously underserved communities; and CityArts, providing funding and assistance for emerging arts groups. In 1984, the council (renamed the Chicago Office of Fine Arts) was combined with the Mayor's Office of Special Events and the Office of Film and Entertainment Industries to constitute the Department of Cultural Affairs.",
