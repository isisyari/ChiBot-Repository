    "Title": "Chicago's Residential Patterns According to Census Racial Categories in 2000",
    "Descriptive Text": "In a city historically renowned for its strong patterns of racial segregation, it is also apparent that the margins between racial groups in geographical space are sometimes quite blurred. This map displays the population of the metropolitan core in units of 200 people by racial categories used by the U.S. Census. For 2000, the population of each group within each census tract was determined as so many dots which have been placed within each tract area (to maintain map legibility tract boundaries not shown). The pattern exhibits strong racial segregation in several parts of this core area, but also countless locales in which people of varying race were found together. Two such areas can be seen east of Midway Airport and in the northern neighborhoods of Chicago south of Evanston."
