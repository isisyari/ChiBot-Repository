    "Title": "Sanitary and Ship Canal",
    "Descriptive Text": "This channel runs 28 miles between Damen Avenue and Lockport, linking the South Branch of the Chicago River to the Des Plaines River. With the construction of a series of locks, the Sanitary and Ship Canal permanently reversed the flow of the Chicago River in 1900. The canal was designed both as a transportation route and a means to improve water quality by sending Chicago's sewage south into the Illinois River instead of into Lake Michigan.",
