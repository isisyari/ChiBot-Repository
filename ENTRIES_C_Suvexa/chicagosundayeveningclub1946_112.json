    "Descriptive Text": "The Chicago Sunday Evening Club began in 1908 with informal religious talks in Orchestra Hall presented by representatives of a variety of denominations. The programs began to be broadcast on radio in 1922, and were brought to television by WTTW in 1956. The series survived on that station into the twenty-first century as a weekly program called 30 Good Minutes. Over the years speakers have included figures as diverse as John Ashcroft, William Dever, W. E. B. DuBois, Emil Hirsch, Bill Kurtis, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Amos Alonzo Stagg."
