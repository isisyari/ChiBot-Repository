    "Title": "Chicago Skyway Bridge over the Calumet River, 1984",
    "Descriptive Text": "In contrast to most of the bridges along the Calumet River, the Chicago Skyway Bridge is not movable. The bridge is seen here in the foreground, looking north up the Calumet River to the two railroad lift bridges. The Chicago Skyway is an expressway linking the Dan Ryan Expressway with the Indiana Toll Road. This 7.5-mile toll road was completed in 1958 by the City of Chicago to connect traffic from the north and east. The toll road includes a bridge which soars 125 feet over the Calumet River, making it possible for ships and land traffic to flow over the river without interruption.",
