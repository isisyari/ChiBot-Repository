    "Title": "Chicago State Hospital, 1947",
    "Descriptive Text": "By the mid-twentieth century, the facilities at the Chicago State Hospital (then commonly known as Dunning Asylum) were outdated and overcrowded. Few of the buildings had been updated since its rebuilding after a fire in 1910. This photo, taken in February 1947, reveals the poorly ventilated, narrow, and congested hallways in which some patients slept."
