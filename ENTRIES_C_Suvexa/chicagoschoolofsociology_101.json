    "Title": "Chicago School of Sociology",
    "Descriptive Text": "When the University of Chicago was founded in 1892, it established the nation's first department of sociology. The study of sociology was still a relatively undeveloped field, but by the 1920s the department had become nationally famous and graduates of its Ph.D. program dominated newly formed sociology programs across the country. During its early history, Chicago sociology was connected with progressive reform programs, including Jane Addams's Hull House project. The department pioneered research on urban studies, poverty, the family, the workplace, immigrants, and ethnic and race relations, and developed important research methods using mapping and survey techniques.",
