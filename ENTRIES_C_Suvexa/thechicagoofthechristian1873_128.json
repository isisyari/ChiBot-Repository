    "Title": "The Chicago of the Christian, 1873",
    "Descriptive Text": "A year before theologically conservative Presbyterian ministers put David Swing on trial before an ecclesiastical tribunal on charges of doctrinal error, Swing contributed an essay on \"the Chicago of the Christian\" to a magazine that presented a series of perspectives on the city. Swing saw religious concerns as inevitably lagging behind the commercial energies of a booming young city, but he also offered insights into the ways in which the gritty business of the city put a characteristic stamp of practicality on the city's religious expression. David Swing in Lakeside Monthly, October 1873, pp. 335-338."
