    "Title": "Commemorating the Visit of Pope John Paul II, Chicago Tribune, 1979",
    "Descriptive Text": "Pope John Paul II's visit to Chicago in October 1979 and his celebration of mass at the Polish parish of Five Holy Martyrs in Brighton Park was a civic event that seemed to merit permanent commemoration by the city. Although the 12th ward alderman felt blindsided by Mayor Jane Byrne's proposal to rename part of a street in his ward, the name change eventually passed."
