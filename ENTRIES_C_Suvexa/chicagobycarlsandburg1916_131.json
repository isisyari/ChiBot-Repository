    "Title": "Chicago by Carl Sandburg, 1916",
    "Descriptive Text": "Carl Sandburg's poetic epithet for Chicago, \"hog butcher for the world,\" is often misremembered as \"hog butcher to the world,\" but that is perhaps less a mistake than a sign of how much the phrase now belongs to popular memory, along with the phrase \"city of [the] big shoulders,\" from the same poem. Though the stockyards have long been closed, the repetition of these phrases continues to carry a memory of Chicago's industrial past, even to many who will never read Sandburg's poems nor any of the many histories of the stockyards."
