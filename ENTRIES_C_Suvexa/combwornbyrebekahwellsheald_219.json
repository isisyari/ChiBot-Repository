    "Title": "Comb Worn by Rebekah Wells Heald",
    "Descriptive Text": "Captain Nathan Heald and Rebekah Heald were taken captive by the British following the battle on August 15, 1812. When a friend saw some of their belongings, including this distinctive hair comb, on sale in St. Louis, he assumed they were dead. He sent the items to Rebekah's family in Louisville. Months later, the Healds were released and made their way to Rebekah's family home. The comb remained among Rebekah's possessions until her death."
