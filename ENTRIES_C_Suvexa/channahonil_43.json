    "Descriptive Text": "Will County, 43 miles SW of the Loop. Channahon, reportedly named from a Potawatomi word meaning “meeting of waters,” rests at the confluence of the Des Plaines, Kankakee, and DuPage Rivers. The town grew inthe 1840s with the construction of the Illinois & Michigan Canal, but its growth slowed as railroads replaced waterway connections. More recently, oil and chemical corporations, interstate highways (55 and 80), and affordable new housing have attracted new residents.",
