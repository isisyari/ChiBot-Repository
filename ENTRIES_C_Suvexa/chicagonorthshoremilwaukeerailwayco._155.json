    "Title": "Chicago, North Shore & Milwaukee Railway Co.",
    "Descriptive Text": "This commuter rail line originated when a short street railway between North Chicago and Waukegan was finished in 1892. In 1908, the line extended to Milwaukee; 11 years later, when it was owned by local utilities titan Samuel Insull, it obtained access to downtown Chicago. The road's “Electroliner” train, introduced in 1941, was a popular innovation. By the latter part of the 1940s, annual revenues were about $10 million. By 1963, the road had ceased to operate.",
