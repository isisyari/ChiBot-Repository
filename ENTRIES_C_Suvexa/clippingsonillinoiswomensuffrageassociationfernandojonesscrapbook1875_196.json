    "Title": "Clippings on Illinois Women Suffrage Association (Fernando Jones Scrapbook), 1875",
    "Descriptive Text": "Prairie Avenue resident Jane G. Jones was a longtime and outspoken activist for women suffrage and president of the Illinois Women Suffrage Association. These newspaper clippings pasted into the scrapbook of her husband Fernando capture many of the arguments ranging from immigration to taxation used in the waning years of Reconstruction in efforts to secure women's right to vote. The articles also provide insights into the dismissive voice used by opponents to undermine the goals of the suffragists."
