    "Title": "Indonesians",
    "Descriptive Text": "Indonesians started arriving in Chicago in 1883. Immigration to the United States has been slow, and they do not form a sizeable or recognizable community in the Chicago area. The community of fewer than 1,000 was scattered all over metropolitan Chicago in 2000. It encompassed Christians, largely of Chinese descent, and Muslims, who were likely to be of indigenous Indonesian ancestry. Many of the Christians came from affluent backgrounds, arriving in Chicago as students supported by their parents back home. Muslims have more often come on scholarships provided by the Indonesian government. Some have decided to settle in Chicago, having married Americans.",
