    "Title": "DuPage River",
    "Descriptive Text": "The 84-mile DuPage River drains most of DuPage and western Will counties, one of the most rapidly developing areas in the Chicago region. This sprawling development tends to degrade the stream and its watershed. Nonetheless, the DuPage River, largest tributary of the Des Plaines, remains quite a beautiful stream.The DuPage has two branches. The shallow eastern branch flows through the Morton Arboretum and has not been developed for canoeing. The west branch is an active water trail and passes through forest preserves and wooded areas. There are five dams on the west branch, and the stone cascade of Warrenville Dam creates a natural-looking waterfall. The west branch winds through Naperville, where an attractive riverwalk borders the stream. A dam near Channahon creates a slack water pool where the Illinois & Michigan Canal crosses the DuPage. The last mile above the confluence with the Des Plaines is a haven for bass fishing.",
