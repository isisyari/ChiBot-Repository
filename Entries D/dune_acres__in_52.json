    "Descriptive Text": "Porter County, 32 miles SE of the Loop. Dune Acres, platted in 1923, was envisioned as an exclusive, year-round shore-line community akin to those found along Illinois' north shore. By the 1930s it had quickly become a recreational community of summer homes, many owned by Chicagoans, with few permanent residents. It is now surrounded by the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.",
