  "Title": "Ardis Joan Krainik and the Lyric Opera",
  "Descriptive Text": "Ardis Joan Krainik followed in the tradition of Chicago's great female opera company directors, a tradition that began with Mary Garden in 1921 and continued through the 27-year era of the company's cofounder (with Nicola Rescigno and Lawrence Kelly) and first general manager, Carol Fox. Krainik had served (from 1954) as supporting singer, chorus member, and, since 1960, assistant manager, before her appointment to the Lyric's top administrative post in 1981, following the retirement of Fox. Within months she recouped the theater's failing fortunes and put it in the black. Her shrewd business sense, artistic vision, and personal warmth were instrumental in establishing the Lyric as one of the world's leading opera companies, a prime American base for the foremost international singers, conductors, stage directors, and designers.",
