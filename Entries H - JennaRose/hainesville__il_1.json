    "Descriptive Text": "Lake County, 39 miles NW of the Loop. Elijah Haines platted a village along the Waukegan to McHenry stagecoach trail in 1846. Residents organized a village government the following year, making Hainesville the oldest incorporated community in Lake County. When the Milwaukee Road Railroad set its construction camp at Round Lake in 1899, Hainesville languished for almost a century. The population of 134 in 1990 grew suddenly, to 2,129, in 2000.",
