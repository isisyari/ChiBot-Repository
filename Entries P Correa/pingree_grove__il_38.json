    "Descriptive Text": "Kane County, 42 miles W of the Loop. Settled by the Pingree family from New Hampshire in the 1830s, the town remains one of the smallest in Kane County, with a population of 124 in 2000. In the 1870s, the construction of the Chicago & Pacific railroad brought modest growth. At the end of the twentieth century the railroad no longer stopped in Pingree Grove, and the brick factory and dairy farm that once thrived there had long since shut down.",
