    "Title": "Printer's Row",
    "Descriptive Text": "After the completion of Dearborn Street Station in 1885, this area in the southern part of the Loop became the printing center of the Midwest. The heart of Printer's Row—a two-block area between Congress Parkway and Polk Street along Dearborn—features examples of the First Chicago School of Architecture, including the Duplicator Building (1886) and the Pontiac Building (1891). In the late 1970s developers began to convert printing centers such as the Donohue Building into loft-style apartments, and Dearborn Street Station was converted to retail space.",
