    "Title": "Minooka, IL",
    "Descriptive Text": "Grundy and Will Counties, 44 miles SW of the Loop. Minooka incorporated in 1869 as a thriving town along the Rock Island Railroad. Originally called “the summit” by railroad workers because it represented the highest point along the Rock Island line, Minooka was renamed by early settler Dolly Smith, after a Potawatomi word purportedly meaning “good land” or “high place.” In the late twentieth century, Minooka boomed thanks to proximity to Interstate 80 and chemical, oil, and power industry jobs opportunities along the Des Plaines River.",
