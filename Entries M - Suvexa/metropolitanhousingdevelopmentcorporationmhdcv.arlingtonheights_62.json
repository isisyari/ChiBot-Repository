    "Title": "Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation (MHDC) v. Arlington Heights",
    "Descriptive Text": "The MHDC v. Arlington Heights case is significant because the Supreme Court allowed that there could be a violation of the 1968 Fair Housing Act without a finding of intent. The Seventh Circuit then held that in some circumstances there could be a violation of the Fair Housing Act when there is a racial impact or racial effect. In the Arlington Heights case a purportedly neutral zoning procedure and decision were determined to have a racial impact constituting a violation of the Fair Housing Act. The case has opened a large number of opportunities to build affordable open housing throughout the Chicago area and other parts of the country.In 1970 the Roman Catholic order Clerics of St. Viator agreed to let the Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation build an affordable housing development on vacant land adjacent to St. Viator High School. A petition was filed with the village to obtain necessary zoning and building approval for the development of Lincoln Green, which would be available without regard to race or national origins. Massive and bitter opposition by “anti-Viatorian advocates” ensued at a series of boisterous zoning and council meetings.The village board voted against the development and the matter went to the U.S. District Court. After negotiating a settlement and protecting it from attacks by a neighboring municipality and homeowners nearby, integrated, affordable housing for families and seniors, called Linden Place, was built. At the time it was opened the mayor of Arlington Heights spoke of it as one of the best developments in Arlington Heights.",
