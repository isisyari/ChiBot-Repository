    "Descriptive Text": "The Metropolitan Community Church (MCC)—whose doctrine is mainstream Protestantism —has openly welcomed gay and lesbian parishioners since its founding in Los Angeles in 1968. The Good Shepherd Parish MCC, chartered in Chicago in 1970, was the first MCC congregation outside of California, an expansion that has produced more than 300 churches in 19 countries.The Chicago congregation's initial meetings took place in founder Reverend Arthur Green's living room. They soon moved to the Broadway United Methodist Church and eventually began renting space from the Wellington Avenue United Church of Christ. The first MCC parish in Chicago has in turn nurtured others in the area, and MCC congregants can be found worshipping in Batavia, Hinsdale, Hyde Park, Evanston, Waukegan, and Oak Park.In 1987, the Good Shepherd Parish established an AIDS ministry outreach program at Illinois Masonic Medical Center. The parish has also been an active supporter of the Northside Ecumenical Night Ministry and the AIDS Pastoral Care Network.",
