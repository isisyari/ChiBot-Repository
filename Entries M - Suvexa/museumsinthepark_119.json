    "Title": "Museums in the Park",
    "Descriptive Text": "Through an annual tax, Chicagoans provide for the maintenance and care of museums located in Chicago's parks. In 1903, voters approved the tax measure which had been proposed by the South Park District Commissioners. The commissioners declared that with this funding the institutions would be better able to serve more of Chicago's burgeoning population. These revenues benefit nine museums: the Art Institute of Chicago, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Adler Planetarium, the John G. Shedd Aquarium, the Chicago Historical Society, the Chicago Academy of Sciences, the Museum of Science and Industry, the DuSable Museum of African American History, and the Mexican Fine Arts Center Museum.",
