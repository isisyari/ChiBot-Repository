    "Title": "Morrison, Plummer & Co.",
    "Descriptive Text": "In 1876, Robert Morrison and Jonathan W. Plummer moved their three-year-old drug wholesaling business from Richmond, Indiana, to Chicago. At the turn of the century, Morrison's son James became the company's president. In 1915, when the company employed about 300 people, an association with the business of Charles Fuller created the Fuller-Morrison Co., one of the leading drug wholesalers in the United States. Like many other wholesale drug distributors, Fuller-Morrison eventually joined with the McKesson & Robbins; in the 1930s, the Chicago-based firm was known as McKesson-Fuller-Morrison.",
