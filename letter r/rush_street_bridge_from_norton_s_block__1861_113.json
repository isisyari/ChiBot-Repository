    "Title": "Rush Street Bridge from Norton's Block, 1861",
    "Descriptive Text": "This engraving bears a strongly resemblance to the photograph of the previous year of the swing bridge at Rush Street. The bridge approaches are cleaner in the engraving, but the overall design of the bridge is consistent in both. The engraving has, though, added more activity to the scene: sailing and steam ships are new in the artistic rendering, as are more people approaching the bridge itself. Smoke belches from nearby factories (and the steamship), a mid-nineteenth century sign of economic health."
