    "Title": "Revised Preliminary Plan of Grant Park, 1903",
    "Descriptive Text": "Among the many proposals for Grant Park was this one prepared by Frederick Law Olmsted's sons for the South Park Commission in 1903. The Field Columbian Museum (note how much larger it is than the original Art Institute of Chicago building) dominates the park. It is situated, as the Plan of Chicago would recommend, along an extended Congress Street. North and south of the museum are large meadows, to the east are a boat landing and a lakeshore parkway bordered by trees, and to the west are the Illinois Central right-of-way, a landscaped line of basins, and then Michigan Avenue."
