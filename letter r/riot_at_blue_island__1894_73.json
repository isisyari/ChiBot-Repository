    "Descriptive Text": "The unrest at Blue Island sketched here in the Chicago Tribune led Attorney General Richard Olney to request federal troops to preserve order during the Pullman boycott. The investigation by the U.S. Strike Commission concluded that, in addition to 12 persons who died, the railroads lost at least $4,672,916; Pullman workers lost at least $350,000 in wages; and the 100,000 employees on the 24 railroads centering in Chicago lost wages of at least $1,389,143. In addition, \"very great losses, widely distributed, were incidentally suffered throughout the country.\""
