    "Title": "Rush for Life Over the Randolph Street Bridge (Chicago In Flames)",
    "Descriptive Text": "The Currier & Ives lithograph shows people fleeing across the Randolph Street Bridge. Thousands of people literally ran for their lives before the flames, unleashing remarkable scenes of terror and dislocation. \"The whole earth, or all we saw of it, was a lurid yellowish red,\" wrote one survivor. \"Everywhere dust, smoke, flames, heat, thunder of falling walls, crackle of fire, hissing of water, panting of engines, shouts, braying of trumpets, roar of wind, confusion, and uproar.\""
