    "Title": "Rolling Mechanism on Cermak Road bridge (Scherzer Rolling Lift), looking north, n.d.",
    "Descriptive Text": "Engineer William Scherzer developed a rolling lift bridge that had two leaves that rolled back onto each bank. This bridge was inexpensive and easy to maintain, but weaknesses emerged over time. The Cermak Road Bridge is one of the remaining bridges of this type at 500 West Cermak."
