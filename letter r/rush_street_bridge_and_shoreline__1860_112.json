    "Title": "Rush Street Bridge and Shoreline, 1860",
    "Descriptive Text": "The first bridge across the main stem of the Chicago River at Rush Street was constructed in 1857. It was an iron and timber swing bridge with a center support. It shows the early use of iron for a western bridge. Construction costs totaled $48,000. The center support is clearly seen in this 1860 photograph looking south to the bridge. Note that there are no gates at the end of the bridge even though it was routine for the bridge to swing open with people, vehicles and animals standing on the bridge."
