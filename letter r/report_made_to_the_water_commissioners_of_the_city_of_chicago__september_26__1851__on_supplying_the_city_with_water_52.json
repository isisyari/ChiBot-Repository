    "Descriptive Text": "The failure to find a cure for cholera did not leave Chicagoans helpless, as they came to realize that water played an important role in the spread of the disease. In 1851, the City commissioned William McAlpine, an engineer with experience on the Erie Canal, to recommend a public water supply system to both prevent disease and fight fire."
